# Ninja_Fall
**Submission for IU Hackathon**


Hey Judges, welcome to our Github for our IU Hackathon Submission! Below we will go through each of our main components in our code along with our steps that we took throughout the project!


**Initial Step- BrainStorming**

We came up with several game concepts during our initial brainstorming session. However, many of these game concepts appeared to be repetitious, dull, or had previously been developed. As a result, we were able to eliminate several of these concepts. We had three primary concepts remaining in our last faze, and Ninja Fall stood out the most!

**Second Step- Planning**

We laid out the aesthetic and the game's key objectives in the next stage. We decided to divide teams at this point. Tanishq would be in charge of the game's art, while Lakshay would be in charge of the programming. They were both working to their strengths, although Lakshay first struggled with scratch because it was his first experience developing a real program on the application. However, after hours of youtube tutorials Lakshay had gained the experience needed to program the application on Scratch. All while Lakshay was busy programming the game's physics, Tansihq was making character and block models for the ninja fall game.
