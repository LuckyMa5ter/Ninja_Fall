# Jetpack Agent (Formerly Ninja Fall)
**Submission for IU Hackathon**


Hello judges, welcome to our GitHub page for our IU Hackathon Submission! Below we will go through each of our main components in our code along with our steps that we took throughout the project!


**Initial Step- Brainstorming**

We came up with several game concepts during our initial brainstorming session. However, many of these game concepts appeared to be repetitious, dull, or had previously been developed. As a result, we were able to eliminate several of these concepts. We had three primary concepts remaining in our last phase, and Jetpack Agent stood out the most!

**Second Step- Planning**

We laid out the aesthetic and the game's key objectives in the next stage. We decided to divide teams at this point. Tanishq would be in charge of the game's art, while Lakshay would be in charge of the programming. They were both working to their strengths, although Lakshay first struggled with Scratch because it was his first experience developing a real program on the application. However, after hours of youtube tutorials Lakshay had gained the experience needed to program the application on Scratch. All while Lakshay was busy programming the game's physics, Tansihq was making character and block models for the jetpack platformer game.

**Third Step- Iteration**

We went through several iterations throughout the course of our project. Our first iteration consisted just of a character and physics implementation. With the physics we had, though, we proceeded to extend and improve. It was very easy to develop the game because this method of iterating content was similar to working with an engine as we had all the physics. The last iterations included actually implementing the final art models into out project.

**Challenges**

Throughout the course of our endeavor, we faced several challenges. The failure to comprehend how Scratch works was one of the first hurdles. Furthermore, because scratch does not have a version history, we encountered issues with our work not saving or being overridden. Another hurdle will be learning how to utilize GitHub to provide good documentation for our project.

# Coding and Documentation

**Physics**

**1.**

In our game, we needed to give the allusion of our character flying up a tunnel. This was our primary goal as we had to make the game look as real as possible. We were able to accomplish this by using a technique which teleported the background every time it reached the very top. This helped us give the allusion of our character falling.

**2.**

Another crucial part of our game is how our protagonist interacts with his environment. Some code that we have added to our project to empahsize this is the fact that the character may not touch the obstacles or they risk being eliminated, or the fact that they can move up,down, left, and right. We also used special techniques to randomly generate obstacles for the player to encounter.
